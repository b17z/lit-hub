### Hardware Wallets
Hardware wallets are devices that operate a secure self-contained bitcoin wallet on special-purpose hardware. They are operated via USB with a desktop web browser or via near-field-communication (NFC) on a mobile device. By handling all bitcoin-related operations on the specialized hardware, these wallets are considered very secure and suitable for storing large amounts of bitcoin.`[1]`

### Ledger
Currently the only Hardware Wallet that supports Vertcoin is [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/). Ledger has included detailed instructions to accompany their hardware wallet found [here](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/start/ledger-nano-s), the wallet interface is managed via the ledger client, Ledger requires you write down a 24 word seed phrase and safeguard in the event that you lose or damage the device.

!!!warning "Seed Phrase"
    Make sure you purchase your Ledger from a trusted retailer. People have had their funds stolen due to using pre-generated seed phrases that came with it from unauthorized resellers. If you believe your device may have been tampered with, or if it comes with a pre-generated seed phrase, **reset the device in order to generate a new private key and seed phrase before sending any funds.**

### Trezor
[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) is another Hardware wallet that is popular in the Bitcoin community, which unlike the ledger hardware wallets doesn't use a standalone client. trezor uses a [website]((https://wallet.trezor.io/) to which you trezor wallet connects.
